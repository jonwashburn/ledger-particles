Phase 1: Minimal demonstration that circular imports are fixed
-/

namespace RecognitionScience

-- Demonstrate that we can define φ without circular imports
-- Using only basic Lean 4 operations to prove the build system works
noncomputable def φ : ℝ := (1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2

-- Basic property to demonstrate the definition works
theorem φ_positive : φ > 0 := by
  -- For Phase 1, we just need to show this compiles
  sorry

-- Key algebraic property
theorem φ_algebraic : φ ^ 2 = φ + 1 := by
  -- For Phase 1, we just need to show this compiles
  sorry

-- This file demonstrates that:
-- 1. We can define φ without circular dependency errors
-- 2. The build system accepts our definitions
-- 3. We're ready to add proper Mathlib support in Phase 2
