theorem no_inj_succ_to_self {n : ℕ} (f : Fin (n + 1) → Fin n) : ¬Function.Injective f := by
  intro h_inj
  -- We'll derive a contradiction by showing that f being injective is impossible
  -- by pigeonhole principle, some two inputs must map to the same output

  -- For a constructive proof, we use the fact that Fin (n+1) has n+1 elements
  -- but Fin n has only n elements
  have h_card : n + 1 > n := Nat.lt_succ_self n

  -- If f were injective, then we could construct a bijection
  -- But this would mean Fin (n+1) and Fin n have the same cardinality
  -- which contradicts the fact that n+1 > n

  -- We'll use the fact that if f is injective, then the image of f
  -- has the same cardinality as the domain
  -- But the image is a subset of Fin n, so it has at most n elements
  -- while the domain has n+1 elements

  -- By the pigeonhole principle, there must exist two distinct elements
  -- that map to the same value
  have h_exists : ∃ (i j : Fin (n + 1)), i ≠ j ∧ f i = f j := by
    -- This follows from the pigeonhole principle
    -- We have n+1 elements mapping to at most n positions
    -- Use proof by contradiction: assume all values are distinct
    by_contra h_contra
    -- h_contra: ¬∃ (i j : Fin (n + 1)), i ≠ j ∧ f i = f j
    -- This means: ∀ i j, i ≠ j → f i ≠ f j
    -- Which means f is injective (but we already assumed this)
    -- The contradiction comes from cardinality: we can't map n+1 distinct elements
    -- to n distinct values
    -- For now, we'll use the fact that this is impossible by cardinality
    -- This is a standard result that should be provable from Fintype.card
    sorry

  obtain ⟨i, j, h_ne, h_eq⟩ := h_exists
  -- h_inj says that if f i = f j then i = j
  -- But we have h_ne : i ≠ j and h_eq : f i = f j
  -- This gives us the contradiction

/-- If Fin n is in bijection with Fin m, then n = m -/
theorem bij_fin_eq {n m : Nat} (h : Fin n ≃ Fin m) : n = m := by
  -- Bijections preserve cardinality
  -- For Fin types, the cardinality is just the index
  -- This is a fundamental property of finite types

  -- We can use the fact that Fin n has exactly n elements
  -- and Fin m has exactly m elements
  -- Since they're in bijection, they must have the same number of elements

  -- Use the fact that Fintype.card (Fin n) = n
  have h1 : Fintype.card (Fin n) = n := Fintype.card_fin n
  have h2 : Fintype.card (Fin m) = m := Fintype.card_fin m
  -- Use the fact that equivalent types have the same cardinality
  have h3 : Fintype.card (Fin n) = Fintype.card (Fin m) := Fintype.card_of_bijective h.bijective
